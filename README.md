Validate access on subsequent visits by entering the saved pin.
Technical Requirements

## Design parameters are provided in Figma, organized into:
UI-KIT: Atomic elements for the Pinpad.
Desktop: Specifications for larger screens.
Mobile: Adjustments for mobile resolutions.

## Navigation Flow
First Visit: The user sets a pin through a modal dialog, entering only numbers.
Subsequent Visits: The user must enter the saved pin to gain access. After three failed attempts, the user will be redirected.
